## Introduction

Hey there, I'm Johnny O'Shea, a computer science student at NC State. I am passionate about animals and the biodiversity of the world. I wanted to 
be able to access information about rare and endangered animals without searching endlessly for an encyclopedia. In an attempt to fulfill that task
and make learning about North Carolina's protected animals more fun and interactive, I created this program which allows you to dive into the world 
of wildlife, search for unique animals, and discover fascinating facts about them. üêæüåç

## Features

- **Search by Name**: Use the search bar to find information about a specific animal.
      * If your search does not result with one animal then the first 5 animals who satisfy the search will appear.
- **Filter by Class**: Explore different animal classes, from birds to reptiles.
- **Learn More**: Dive deep into the animal's information by clicking the "Learn More" button.
- **Fun Facts**: Discover interesting and quirky facts about our furry, feathered, and scaly friends.
- **Statistics**: Get insights into the demographics of the protected animal species in NC.
