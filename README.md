## Introduction

Hey there, I'm Johnny O'Shea, a computer science student at NC State. I am passionate about animals and the biodiversity of the world. I wanted to 
be able to access information about rare and endangered animals without searching endlessly for an encyclopedia. In an attempt to fulfill that task
and make learning about North Carolina's protected animals more fun and interactive, I created this program which allows you to dive into the world 
of wildlife, search for unique animals, and discover fascinating facts about them. üêæüåç

## Features

- **Search by Name**: Use the search bar to find information about a specific animal.
      * If your search does not result with one animal then the first 5 animals who satisfy the search will appear.
- **Filter by Class**: Explore different animal classes, from birds to reptiles.
- **Learn More**: Dive deep into the animal's information by clicking the "Learn More" button.
- **Fun Facts**: Discover interesting and quirky facts about our furry, feathered, and scaly friends.
- **Statistics**: Get insights into the demographics of the protected animal species in NC.

## Skills Demonstrated
- This program is an excelent display of the java programming language and OOP capabilities.
- There are multiple ENUMs used to simplify accessing unique parts of an animal.
- The program takes use of linear data structures such as an array-based list for an efficient solution.
- Models a database and transforms a surplus amount of data into useful information.
- Implements a custom UI built fully from scratch using the GUI frameworks. 
  
## Usage

1. Enter the name of an animal in the search bar or select the row of an animal you want to learn more about.
2. Click "Learn More" or "enter" to explore detailed information about the animal.
3. Use the filter to narrow down your search by animal class.
4. Enjoy fun facts, pictures, and statistics about North Carolina's protected animals.
5. Select "reset" if you want to go back and see a different animal.
